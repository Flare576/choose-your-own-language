# Choose-Your-Own-Language

Proof of concept of a story-driven system where you can change languages at-will, potentially offering a more incentivized
mechanism to learn languages. 

Initial concept is that `/stories/` would contain folders for each story, with subfolders for each language but matching
file structures to allow quick switching.

If that proves unmanageable (and it very well could), a DB-based solution will need to be created.
